Seam Blog Example
====================
This example demonstrates the use of Seam in a Java EE 5 environment.
Transaction and persistence context management is handled by the
EJB container.

This example runs on JBoss AS as an EAR or Tomcat with JBoss Embedded as a WAR.

JBoss AS 4.2 needs additional hibernate libraries, use ant target jboss42 for deploying to it.
